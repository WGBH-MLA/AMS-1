Archival Management System Development ( Corporation for Public Broadcasting ) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMS Development Project (CBP), The American Archive seeks to preserve and make accessible to the public the legacy of public media content produced for national and local distribution over a span of six decades. It will ensure that the cumulative public investment of billions of dollars in non-commercial media over the years is fully protected for generations to come.
 
Already, the project has identified nearly 2.5 million records through the Content Inventory Project (CIP), including completed local and national programs, raw footage, unedited interviews, recorded speeches, transcripts, and more. This totals more than one million hours of video, film, and audio recordings from 119 stations. CPB plans to digitize and preserve 40,000 hours of video and audio content, nominated by CIP participants.  Having established a framework for a coordinated local/national archiving effort, CPB is poised to conclude its incubation of the American Archive and secure an appropriate, permanent institutional home (“Future Home”) for this overall effort.
 
The core goal of the Archival Management System (“AMS”) is to provide the backbone of the American Archive by facilitating the search and retrieval of metadata collected during the inventory, digitization and preservation phases.
